# Windows PC Diagnostic Script

A simple PowerShell script to perform basic diagnostics on a Windows PC. The script checks the health of critical components, including the disk, battery, memory (RAM), processor (CPU), and system files, and provides clear, user-friendly results indicating whether each component is functioning properly.

## Features

- **Disk Health**: Checks the physical and SMART status of all connected disks.
- **Battery Health**: Generates a detailed battery report (if applicable).
- **RAM Check**: Verifies the amount of installed memory and its sufficiency.
- **CPU Usage**: Monitors current CPU load.
- **Temperature**: Reads hardware temperature sensors (if available).
- **System File Check**: Validates the integrity of Windows system files.
- **Clear Results**: Displays results as `OK` or `Not OK` with explanations for any detected issues.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (pre-installed on Windows 10 and above).
- Administrator privileges to execute the script.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Script**  
Clone this repository or download the `.ps1` script file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/windows-pc-diagnostic.git
```

2.	Run PowerShell as Administrator
Open PowerShell with administrator privileges:
* Press Win + S, type PowerShell, right-click, and select Run as Administrator.

3.	Allow Script Execution (if necessary)
If PowerShell script execution is restricted, allow it temporarily:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

4.	Run the Script
Navigate to the folder containing the script and execute it:
```bash
.\health_check.ps1
```

5.	View Results
The script will display clear results for each diagnostic check directly in the PowerShell terminal.
```bash
